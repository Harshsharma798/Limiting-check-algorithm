# Limiting-check-algorithm
This algorithm will checks whether the number is prime or not. This is made by combining the valuable research of IIT, Kanpur described in their research paper "Primes is in P" and the research done in 200 BC by Greek Mathematicians known as "Sieve of Eratosthenes"

This is the algorithm to check the primality of a number of higher magnitude (lower as well).

To test a number whether it is prime or not, you just have to run the "running_algorithm.py" file which will ask you to enter a number and that number is tested against various parameter to check whether its prime or not and the result is displayed to your console along with the time taken by the algorithm to check that number.

You can choose any number of your choice or you can pick a number of given magnitude from a list of random prime numbers of various orders from the file "random_prime_numbers.txt" all the numbers here are prime and are of high order which will take a long time if checked by the casual algorithm.

Along with that we have a graphical representation also to display the result of our algorithm on those random numbers in various .png files where in graph X-axis is the number itself and Y-axis is the time taken by the algorithm to implement a check on that number

You do not need to run any other file if you just want to check the number you just need to run "running_algorithm.py" and all the other files are internally connected to it.
